ECE-551 final project
# Quadcopter-FPGA
Designed and tested an FPGA chip in to control the quadcopter with another partner. It receives commands wirelessly with a long-range Bluetooth module with a UART interface and gets the data from the inertial sensor with SPI to control the ESC motor. It was designed with the system Verilog and was also synthesized with Synopsis Design Vision.
